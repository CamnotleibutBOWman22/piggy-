    <h1> Did you know #Elephant facts </h1> 
    <h6> The <em> Elephant </em> makes a low rumbling sound that can be heard up to 5 miles away.</h6>
    <h6> The <em> Elephant </em> is one of the smartest animals on the planet. It is one of the few species that exhibit actual self-awareness and self-recognition. It appears to use tools, for example, as a fly swatter. And it has an excellent ability to learn and remember details. Scientists still debate whether <em> Elephants </em> mourn their dead, but these creatures do appear to have some interior emotional life.</h6>
    <h6> <em> Elephant </em> are one of my favorite animals. </h6> 
    <h6> I got this info off of Google </h6>
    <h6> Bye have a good day </h6>
